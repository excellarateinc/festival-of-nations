                | playing an active role in one of Minnesota’s best events, you’re allowing us to spend
                | our funding on cultural attractions, performances and food rather than administrative costs. All
                | volunteers receive free admittance to the Festival - thank you in advance! We couldn’t make
                | the Festival of Nations great without you.

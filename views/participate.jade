            p The Festival of Nations depends on volunteers for its success! By volunteering, not only are you playing an active role in one of Minnesota’s best events, you’re allowing us to spend our funding on cultural attractions, performances and food rather than administrative costs. All volunteers receive free admittance to the Festival – thank you in advance! We couldn’t make the Festival of Nations great without you.
            h3 General Information
            ul
                li Volunteers help with the Festival in a variety of ways. Common assignments include assisting in a booth selling food, beverages or passports; greeting the public; answering questions; or helping with setup and tear-down.
                li Most shifts are three hours long. Shift times may vary depending on day and assignment.
                li It is not guaranteed that you will be placed at your desired assignment, but we will do our best. We reserve the right to change or alter assignments due to scheduling needs.
                li Volunteers receive free entrance into the Festival. You can enjoy the Festival either before or after your shifts, as long as the Festival is open to the public.
                li Those working during student hours (all day Thursday, and Friday until 3 p.m.) will receive an additional free ticket to come back another day.
                li All volunteers are encouraged to dress in ethnic attire. If you do not have an ethnic costume, you can rent one (free of charge) at the International Institute of Minnesota before the Festival or prior to the start of your shift at the Festival. Specific details will be in your informational packet.
                li To help in the Festival Office at the International Institute of Minnesota prior to the event with tasks such as mailing out tickets and preparing information packets or to help repair ethnic costumes (learn more here), please e-mail Faith at floggers-jamnik@iimn.org.
                li Those who work in the Festival Office prior to the event, assist with costume repairs or work during setup and tear-down hours will receive a complimentary ticket for the Festival.
                li Your tickets(s) and information packet will be mailed to you by April 15th.

            p If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Faith Loggers-Jamnik during the days of Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday at floggers-jamnik@iimn.org.
